Chronobiology GoLang Package
==========================

This is an open source package developed to provide **chronobiology** functions in **GoLang**.

----------

:shipit: What is GoLang?
---------------------------------
**Go**, also known as **GoLang**, is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

The Go programming language was developed by **Google** and released in 2009. To know more about the **GoLang** please visit the official [web site][1].

:clock10: What is chronobiology?
---------------------------------

Basically, **chronobiology** is a field of biology that studies the periodic phenomena in living organisms and their adaptation to solar and lunar rhythms. These cycles are known as **biological rhythms**.

Chronobiological studies include but are not limited to comparative anatomy, physiology, genetics, molecular biology and behavior of organisms within biological rhythms mechanics.

----------

:octocat: The project
---------------------------------
The **objective** of this project is to provide a easy way to access **chronobiology** functions that can perform **data analysis** in **time series** using **GoLang**.

Some functions that we pretend to provide with the package:

- [X] The followed hours of highest activity (e.g. M10)
- [X] The followed hours of lowest activity (e.g. L5)
- [ ] Relative Amplitude (RA)
- [ ] Intradaily Variability (IV)
- [ ] Interdaily Stability (IS)
- [ ] Chi Square Periodogram
